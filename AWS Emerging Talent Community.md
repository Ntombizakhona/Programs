AWS Emerging Talent Community
=============================

Free AWS Foundational & Associate Vouchers
------------------------------------------

If you’ve been considering a career in cloud computing, there’s no better time than now – and no better place to start than with **AWS’s Emerging Talent Community.**

But here’s something you might not know: the AWS Emerging Talent Community recently moved. It used to live on its own dedicated site, but now it’s been integrated into the [AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com) platform. The platform is cleaner, better connected, and allows easier access to resources designed specifically for early-career cloud talent.

This shift also signals something important: Amazon is streamlining how it supports future cloud professionals.

What is the AWS Emerging Talent Community?
------------------------------------------

It’s a free-to-join global community built for students, recent grads, and anyone making a career switch into tech. You’ll find curated learning paths, career tips, success stories, and perhaps most importantly – opportunities to get certified.

### The Best Part?

### Discounted AWS Vouchers

As of now, being part of the Emerging Talent Community on AWS Educate gives you access to 100% discounted exam vouchers – either for:

1.  Foundational Certifications
2.  Or one of the Associate-level certifications like Solutions Architect or Developer Associate

_These certifications are highly respected and widely recognized. Having one on your résumé can open the door to internships, entry-level roles, and even freelance gigs._

### But Don’t Wait Too Long

While the 100% discount is _incredibly_ _generous_, it’s not guaranteed to last forever. Programs like these are often temporary, updated, or retired without much notice – especially as demand for cloud skills grows.

So if you’re already exploring cloud computing – or even just curious – this is your moment. Take advantage of this opportunity while it’s still available.

How to Access the Discounted Voucher
------------------------------------

1.  Create an account on [AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com)
2.  Complete a relevant course or courses
3.  Wait for an Invitation to the Emerging Talent Community
4.  If you accept the invite, navigate to the “**Emerging Talent Community**” once inside the portal.
5.  Browse the resources and locate the section with certification exam vouchers.
6.  Follow the instructions to apply for a voucher – some may require you to complete a brief learning module first.

Concluding
----------

Getting started in cloud doesn’t have to be expensive or overwhelming. AWS is actively creating pathways for new talent to enter the field – and the Emerging Talent Community is one of the best entry points.

So join the community.

**Get certified.**

And take the first step into a future-proof career – on the cloud.
