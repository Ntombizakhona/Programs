**_What Being a Coach Taught Me About Mentorship_**

When I started coaching, I thought I needed to be at the top of the mountain before I could guide anyone. I quickly learned that mentorship isn’t about reaching the summit, it’s about sharing your path with someone who’s just a few steps behind.

In fact, the best mentors aren’t always the ones with decades of experience or shiny accolades. Often, they’re the ones who’ve just taken the steps you’re about to take. They remember what it felt like to start: the nerves, the doubt, the thrill…and they can offer something incredibly valuable, **direction**.

Mentorship Starts with the Next Step, Not the Final Destination
---------------------------------------------------------------

Getting started on anything new, a course, a career, a calling, can feel like standing at the bottom of a mountain with no idea where the trail begins. Before you go on a headless goose chase trying to figure it all out alone, it’s worth seeking someone who’s already walked the path, _even just part of it._

This person doesn’t need to be a guru. They just need to have _done_ it or better yet, **started**. Their experience can help anchor you, help you begin, and maybe even walk alongside you for part of the way.

Forget the myth of needing a grandmaster, a superstar, or some legend to mentor you. (Unless you’re literally entering a kung fu tournament, in which case, maybe do find that guy Kung Fu Kid.)

Why Starting with “Good Enough” Is Actually Better
--------------------------------------------------

Doing something alone for the first time can be terrifying, and just straight up traumatic honestly. Mentorship doesn’t eliminate the fear, but it gives you a guide, someone to point out the potholes, the shortcuts, and the milestones you might otherwise miss.

_Your first mentor doesn’t need to be perfect. They just need to help you get started._

Let’s say you’re curious about AWS certifications. You don’t need to find the top Solution Architect in the world. You can simply talk to someone who recently passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. They know what it feels like to start from zero. They can tell you what worked, what didn’t, and what to expect and sometimes, that’s more helpful than hearing from someone ten certifications in.

Maybe you’ll stop at Cloud Practitioner. Maybe you’ll go all the way to becoming an AWS Golden Jacket recipient. Either way, your journey will likely involve many mentors along the way, each one serving a different role at a different time.

The Ripple Effect of Mentorship
-------------------------------

As a graduate of the AWS New Voices program, I had the chance to mentor others, not as someone who’s spoken in stadiums or built multi-million-dollar architectures, but as someone who’d simply _done it._

And that was enough.

I could answer questions, offer support, and help someone get their foot in the door. That’s the beauty of mentorship: it’s not about being the loudest or the most decorated, it’s about being available, honest, and real.

Don’t Wait to Seek Mentorship
-----------------------------

You don’t need a “super master” to guide you. You just need someone who’s taken a step you haven’t.

And someday, you might be that person for someone else not because you know everything, but because you were willing to share what you’ve learned.

So if you’re starting something new, find someone who’s just a little further ahead. And if you’ve started something yourself, don’t be afraid to offer a hand to the person behind you.

_That’s mentorship, and it’s more powerful than you think._
