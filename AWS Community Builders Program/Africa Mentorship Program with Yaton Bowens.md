AWS Community Builders Program
==============================

Africa Mentorship Program with Yaton Bowens
-------------------------------------------

Cloud.

Community.

Confidence.

**_From Georgia to Gauteng, mentorship is the bridge that carries knowledge across continents, confidence across communities, and opportunity across generations. It’s not about where you start, it’s about who’s willing to walk with you._**

Mentorship with Yaton Bowens
----------------------------

When I talk about growth in my cloud journey, I have to start with, and **emphasize** mentorship, and more specifically, one of my mentors, _Yaton Bowens_.

Through the Africa Mentorship Program, he’s helped me spark more than just a passion for certifications or code, he’s ignited a deeper commitment to self-development, to building others, and to unlocking and fully using my potential.

_It’s about more than gaining skills, it’s about consistently showing up, not just for what you want to learn, but for the person you’re becoming along the way._

The Mentorship Cycle of the AWS Community
-----------------------------------------

Yaton didn’t just hand me answers, he handed me the confidence and resources to figure things out. And that’s the secret sauce of this program: it’s not about perfection, it’s about _progress_.

You don’t have to be an expert to help someone get started. You just need to be a little further ahead, willing to share what you know.

### Be Mentored, Then Turn Around and Mentor Someone Else

With Yaton’s guidance, I saw firsthand how mentorship works like a cycle. One person gains insight, passes it along, and the momentum continues, from mentee to mentor, across the AWS Community, beyond countries, and career levels.

### Learning, Sharing, Repeating

And here’s what I love about the AWS community (and Yaton exemplifies this so well): they love to **learn**, they love to **read**, and they genuinely love to see others win. You’ll find mentors recommending docs, whitepapers, and hands-on labs. But even more valuable? The stories they tell. The encouragement they offer. The way they help you believe, “_Yes, I can do this._”

**We’re not just exchanging skills in the present we’re exchanging dreams of the future!**

Why This Program Matters
------------------------

This isn’t just about passing a test or adding a badge to your LinkedIn. It’s about creating a pipeline of confident, capable professionals across the continent. It’s about young Africans realizing they’re not just users of technology, they’re _architects_ of it.

Through mentorship, you don’t just learn how to deploy to the cloud. _You learn how to believe in yourself._

Find A Mentor!
--------------

So if you’re feeling unsure, stuck, or just curious about the cloud, find someone who’s walked the path. And when you’re ready, offer your hand to someone behind you.

That’s the power of mentorship. It’s not hierarchical. It’s human.

…**_Because when one of us grows, we all do!_**
