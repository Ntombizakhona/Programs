AWS Community Builders Program
==============================

New Voices Graduate
-------------------


There’s something truly empowering about being heard, especially when you’re still finding your voice in tech.

When I was accepted into the AWS New Voices program, I didn’t just gain access to training and support. I gained confidence, community, and clarity about the value I bring.

As an AWS Community Builder, I can look back and see how both programs have shaped my journey. Each one met me exactly where I was and helped me grow into where I wanted to be.

What is AWS New Voices?
-----------------------

AWS New Voices is an AWS Community Builder’s initiative that equips aspiring public speakers with the tools, mentorship, and encouragement to confidently share their stories.

For me, it was more than learning how to speak, it was learning that I had something worth saying.

Through workshops, feedback sessions, and support from the Coaches, I began shaping technical talks that reflected my unique perspective and experience. Graduating from the program meant I was ready to share those stories on bigger stages.

What is the AWS Community Builders Program?
-------------------------------------------

The AWS Community Builders program supports developers, architects, and tech enthusiasts who are passionate about sharing cloud knowledge.

As a Community Builder, I’ve gained access to AWS credits, technical resources, exclusive webinars, mentorship, and most importantly, a vibrant global network of builders like me.

The program rewards curiosity and community contribution.

_You don’t have to know everything, you just need to be willing to learn and share as you go_.

Why These Programs Matter
-------------------------

Together, these programs have helped me grow as a technologist, communicator, and mentor. They’ve shown me that representation matters, that it’s okay to start where you are, and that the tech world needs diverse voices sharing _real_ experiences.

What’s Next?
------------

More learning, more building, and more giving back. I want to help others find their voice, just like AWS helped me find mine. Whether you’re applying to New Voices or considering becoming a Community Builder, my advice is simple: **Say yes to the opportunity, you never know where it’ll take you.**

Concluding Remarks
------------------

You don’t need to be an expert to be valuable.

You just need to be willing to show up, speak up, and **keep building.**
