# AWS Community Builders Program


2025 Application
----------------

The AWS Community Builders Program is an initiative by Amazon Web Services that offers technical resources, networking opportunities, and educational support to AWS enthusiasts who actively build with AWS services and share their knowledge with the broader community.

Whether through online content like videos and blog posts, or in-person engagements such as presentations and workshops, participants play a crucial role in spreading AWS expertise.

If you deliver in-person presentations or host video conferences, it’s encouraged to record these sessions and make them publicly accessible to maximize their impact.

Benefits
--------

The AWS Community Builders Program is packed with benefits that are both professionally enriching and personally rewarding:

### Networking Opportunities

Connect with a vibrant community of AWS enthusiasts, including AWS User Group leaders, Developer Advocates, Community Builders, and AWS Heroes. These connections offer unique mentorship opportunities and insights that can significantly boost your growth.

### Educational Perks

Gain access to resources like a CloudAcademy (currently known as QA Platform) subscription, which helps advance your cloud knowledge, prepare for certifications, and enable you to share your learning with others while elevating your own expertise.

### Content Creation Support

Receive resources and guidance to enhance your technical writing and content creation skills, helping you create more impactful content.

### Exclusive Perks

Enjoy various benefits and perks that come with the program – many of which you’ll discover upon joining. And yes, AWS is known for its amazing swag, which is just the cherry on top!

Who Should Apply?
-----------------

I strongly encourage all AWS enthusiasts, especially previously disadvantaged groups, and those from marginalized and underrepresented communities, and women to apply. This program is a fantastic opportunity to amplify your voice, share your unique perspective, and connect with a supportive community that values diversity.

If you’re already creating AWS-related technical content and looking to sharpen your skills and expand your network, this program is for you. Having a track record of producing content is advantageous, but if you’re just starting out, don’t be discouraged. The experience will inspire you to create more quality content and apply again next year if necessary.

This program welcomes applicants from all regions, from Africa to the United States, and beyond. If you are 18 years or older, passionate about AWS, and eager to grow, we want you to apply.
