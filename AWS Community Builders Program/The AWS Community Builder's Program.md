The AWS Community Builders Program
==================================

Why Everyone Should Build (And Document It)
-------------------------------------------

My favourite thing about the AWS Community Builders program is simple: it’s packed with access to articles and materials from people who actually _build_ things on the cloud.

### Theorists

_“I read some random subjective pessimistic articles and now I’m here to tell you that_ **_that_** _technology is dead & obsolete!”_

Theorists amplify negative voices, and often discourage beginners in technology or the cloud from ever getting started.

### Builders

_“Here’s an article on what I wish someone had told me before I…” or “Here’s a tutorial on how to…”_

Builders are the kind of people who have broken or built things, fixed them or enhanced them, and then wrote a tutorial the next day, to help other builders and most importantly: **beginners.**

Builders vs. Theorists
----------------------

_Builders win, obviously._

### Practical Content From Builders

When someone is actively building with AWS , whether it’s serverless, containers, data pipelines, networking, security, observability, or machine learning, or this or that, their writing tends to have a few consistent qualities:

**Relevant:** it maps to what people in the relevant field are actually doing right now.
**Informative**: it teaches you _why_ something works, not just what buttons to click.
**Practical:** it includes the messy details (permissions, limits, costs, debugging).
**Realistic:** it acknowledges tradeoffs and constraints, because they have built something.

The articles don’t feel like _imaginary cloud fan fiction._

They feel like a realistic report from someone who just came back from battle with EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) and lived to blog about it!

### Speculative Conjectures From Theorists

On the other side of the spectrum is a special genre of content…

Someone declares an entire technology _dead_ because they personally haven’t used it in three weeks, or even worse, they’ve never ever used it: their knowledge about it, is from other trending theorists.

Theorist articles feel like this person has never even once seen a: “Hello World!” and got excited about the endless possibilities. Just overconsumption of theory, and the endless regurgitation without ever stopping to taste or even digest what they’re spitting out to the world.

A random app notification informs you that a theorist just declared something **obsolete** despite it having:
**1.** updated documentation,
**2**. active maintainers,
**3.** new releases,
**4.** and a community still building, shipping and attending cons and events!

Being a theorist is basically like walking past a busy restaurant, and yelling, **_“This place is closed!”_** while people are literally eating inside, and there’s cleaners and construction crews also actively maintaining the place.

Why Everyone Should Build
-------------------------

When you build, you can’t hide behind abstractions forever. The cloud will politely (and repeatedly) demand evidence.

Building forces you to face reality, and be realistic.

That’s why content from builders tends to be better: _it’s tested against reality._

### **Everyone Should Build**

**Yes, you too, and your grandma and your cat!**

Anyways, **everyone should build**: not because you need to become a full-time engineer or launch a startup tomorrow, but because building gives you:

1.  stronger intuition,
2.  clearer opinions (the useful kind),
3.  and the ability to write technical content that’s grounded.

Even a small project counts, go break something on purpose and document the fix.

**_“I broke it and here’s what I learned_**” is one of the most valuable kinds of technical writing, because there’s someone out there who probably accidentally broke something, misconfigured a resource and could do with your help.

### When You Build, Write About It

(I say **Write About It**, because I have a strong preference for _reading_, but you should **_document_** it in the best way you can)

Technical content doesn’t need to be _perfect_ to be useful. It needs to be **honest and specific**.

If you’re thinking, “_I’m not experienced enough to write,_” consider this:

The person one step behind you needs your post more than they need a post from someone 10 steps ahead who forgot what step 1 felt like.

Write the article.

Make the diagram.

Share the code.

The Podcast.

The Video!

Explain what went wrong and how you fixed it.

That’s how communities become good.

**Don’t Overthink… Build And Document!**

### Concluding Remarks

I know, I know, this article could have been a Tweet ( X), but I like writing soooo…

Anyways, to conclude, The AWS Community Builders Program is great because it elevates people who build and then share what they learned. That creates a loop of **practical knowledge** _that helps everyone_, it’s really nice consuming content from people who actually **_build._**

So yes: everyone should build.

**And if you build something: write about it.**

_The internet has enough “this is dead, that is dying” speeches, honestly._
