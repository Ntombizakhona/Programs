### [1. What is the AWS Community Builders Program?](https://medium.com/aws-community-builders-program-29cd8ae987f5)

> The AWS Community Builders Program is an initiative by Amazon Web Services that offers technical resources, networking opportunities, and educational support to AWS enthusiasts who actively build with AWS services and share their knowledge with the broader community.

### [2. What is the AWS Builder Center?](https://medium.com/aws-builder-center-6384c173be64)

> The [AWS Builder Center](https://builder.aws.com/start) is AWS’s free, centralized platform that combines hands-on learning resources with a vibrant community of builders worldwide.
> 
> Rather than scattered tutorials across blogs and videos, the Builder Center brings everything together in one place — making it easy to find projects that match your current skills, connect with fellow builders, and share your own expertise

### [3. Why Everyone Should Build (And Document It)](https://medium.com/the-aws-community-builders-program-564bace91570)

> **everyone should build**: not because you need to become a full-time engineer or launch a startup tomorrow, but because building gives you:
> 
> 1. stronger intuition,
> 
> 2. clearer opinions (the useful kind),
> 
> 3. and the ability to write technical content that’s grounded.
> 
> Even a small project counts, go break something on purpose and document the fix.
> 
> **_“I broke it and here’s what I learned_**” is one of the most valuable kinds of technical writing, because there’s someone out there who probably accidentally broke something, misconfigured a resource and could do with your help.

### [4. Leverage the AWS Community to Gain Cloud Skills](https://medium.com/@ntombizakhona/leverage-the-aws-community-to-gain-cloud-skills-0d94fbd9ec40)

> Document hands-on implementation, not just theory
> 
> 1. Share the actual solutions you built, complete with code snippets, GitHub repositories, and architecture diagrams.
> 
> 2. Include screenshots of working deployments, templates, or configurations.
> 
> 3. Demonstrate applied knowledge, not just conceptual understanding.

### [5. Explore AWS Builder Center Workshops](https://medium.com/explore-aws-builder-center-workshops-9b7b013a2b44)

> These workshops are designed to help you practice AWS hands-on, reinforce key concepts, and build confidence as you learn.
> 
> If you’re participating in [**Paula Wakabi’s 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge**](https://medium.com/leverage-the-aws-community-to-gain-cloud-skills-0d94fbd9ec40), the Builder Center workshops are a great way to deepen your understanding and make it easier to answer technical questions along the way.
